## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Table séparée vs JSONB | Table permet indexes, FK constraints, métadonnées riches | 2026-01-15 |
| Migration : dernière image = label | Pattern pythonApiWOO, 85% précision, simple | 2026-01-15 |
| Backup complet avant migration | Sécurité absolue : 0 perte acceptée | 2026-01-15 |
| is_label boolean vs enum | Boolean suffisant pour v1, extensible plus tard | 2026-01-15 |
| 100% label rate accepted | ALL products have 2+ images, business rule correctly applied | 2026-01-15 |

---

## Critical Context

### The Problem
- **611 products** have internal "labels" (price tags) being published to Vinted/eBay
- Current JSONB structure: `[{"url": "...", "order": 0, "created_at": "..."}]` - no type field
- Migration 2026-01-03 removed `image_type` when moving to JSONB

### The Solution
- Dedicated `product_images` table with `is_label` boolean flag
- Migration strategy: last image in order = label (pythonApiWOO pattern)
- Filter `is_label=true` in marketplace converters

### Data Safety
- ✅ Full backup: `backups/stoflow_db_full_backup_20260115_091652.dump`
- Idempotent migration scripts
- Transaction-based per schema
- Rollback capability via Alembic downgrade

  - PLAN 3.2: Refactor ProductImageService to use table (business logic)
  - PLAN 3.3: Update API routes and response schemas (API layer)
  - Total estimated duration: 70-100 minutes
  - All plans ready for execution

**2026-01-15 (Night):**
- ✅ **EXECUTED PLAN 3.1** - Created ProductImage Model + Repository

- ✅ **EXECUTED PLAN 3.2** - Refactored ProductImageService to Use Table
  - Refactored all existing methods (add, delete, reorder, get) to use ProductImageRepository
  - Added 3 new methods: get_product_photos(), get_label_image(), set_label_flag()
