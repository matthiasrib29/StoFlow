## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Table séparée vs JSONB | Table permet indexes, FK constraints, métadonnées riches | 2026-01-15 |
| Migration : dernière image = label | Pattern pythonApiWOO, 85% précision, simple | 2026-01-15 |
| Backup complet avant migration | Sécurité absolue : 0 perte acceptée | 2026-01-15 |
| is_label boolean vs enum | Boolean suffisant pour v1, extensible plus tard | 2026-01-15 |
| 100% label rate accepted | ALL products have 2+ images, business rule correctly applied | 2026-01-15 |
| Multi-worktree migration sync | Copy missing migrations from other worktrees when DB is ahead | 2026-01-15 |
| Downgrade with data reconstruction | Use json_agg() to restore JSONB from table for rollback | 2026-01-15 |

---

## Critical Context

### The Problem
- **611 products** have internal "labels" (price tags) being published to Vinted/eBay
- Current JSONB structure: `[{"url": "...", "order": 0, "created_at": "..."}]` - no type field
- Migration 2026-01-03 removed `image_type` when moving to JSONB

### The Solution
- Dedicated `product_images` table with `is_label` boolean flag
- Migration strategy: last image in order = label (pythonApiWOO pattern)
- Filter `is_label=true` in marketplace converters

### Data Safety
- ✅ Full backup: `backups/stoflow_db_full_backup_20260115_091652.dump`
- Idempotent migration scripts
- Transaction-based per schema
- Rollback capability via Alembic downgrade
