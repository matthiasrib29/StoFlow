# Phase 2 Plan 1: Typography System Summary

**Enforced consistent typography with font-display on headings and PrimeVue DataTable styling.**

## Accomplishments

- Added specific h1-h6 rules with font-display and consistent font-weights (bold for h1-h2, semibold for h3-h6)
- Added PrimeVue DataTable header/body styling overrides
- Typography now consistent across all dashboard pages

## Files Created/Modified

- `frontend/assets/css/design-system.css` - Added h1-h6 rules, section 11 PrimeVue overrides

## Decisions Made

- h1-h2 use font-bold, h3-h6 use font-semibold for visual hierarchy
- DataTable headers use font-display with bg-gray-50 for subtle distinction
- No color added to heading rules (components define their own colors)

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Step

Phase 2 complete, ready for Phase 3 (Color System)
