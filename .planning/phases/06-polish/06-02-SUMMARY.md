# Phase 6 Plan 2: Loading States and Hover Effects Summary

**Added skeleton loading utilities and standardized hover effects to design system.**

## Accomplishments

- Added section 18 (LOADING STATES) with skeleton classes
- Added section 19 (HOVER EFFECTS) with standardized hover utilities
- Skeleton classes: .skeleton, .skeleton-text, .skeleton-title, .skeleton-avatar, .skeleton-card, .skeleton-button
- Hover classes: .hover-lift, .hover-subtle, .hover-bg, .hover-border, .hover-scale

## Files Created/Modified

- `frontend/assets/css/design-system.css` - Added sections 18 and 19

## Decisions Made

- Skeleton uses Tailwind's animate-pulse for consistency
- Hover effects use 150-200ms transition for smooth feel
- hover-lift provides subtle elevation effect for cards
- hover-scale limited to 5% to avoid jarring effect

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Step

Phase 6 complete. UI improvement project finalized.
